# RosaceKeyboard
This is a radial keyboard for controllers (tested with a xbox360 controller)

LB = Backspace

RB = Enter

Start = Close the keyboard

Select= Escape

Left Stick = space

Right Stick = Left mouse click


It requires pygame and pyautogui in order to run.


How to use :
- turn on your controller
- start it :D
